TASK:
Asynchronous JS - this can be executed in the browser (i.e. call the file from your html page) - keep it simple.
Today you are going to write a small website that displays two pictures from a search result.
You should do this by using the unsplash API.
You should create a function that returns a promise that makes a call to the unsplash API.
You should then create an async function that calls the function from step 3 twice using an await.
You should then display both images on a website.
Node exercise - the next step up
Create a new route that takes a single text input from a form.
Create a node server file that takes a request and returns the text reversed.
Connect your front end and your backend. The UX should be something like this: user inputs text into the form and presses submit or enter. An API call is made to your node.js server with the text from the form in the request. The nodejs server returns the text in reversed. The frontend receives this and then places it on the frontend for the user to see.
